# Breast_Cancer
Firstly We take breast_cancer_dataset from sklearn.
In that we have 30 arguments as parameter for cancer such as radius, area,etc...
then we create a sequential model from keras to fit the train data.
then add layers, Activation function,optimizer,loss function in the model to get better accuracy.
Finally from the predicted value, we can classify them into malignant and benign.
